## check_all_renewals.py

This script will analyse the Member-Trainings-Report and Member-Vetting-Report spreadsheets that can be downloaded from the Scouting Ireland MMS at my.scouts.ie and will print the names and details of any scouters that have either Vetting or Safeguarding renewals due in the next 3 months.
